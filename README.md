# Introduction
This project is aimed to draw a triangulation on a plane.\
The current tools, such as networkx, perform not well,
so this is why this project emerges.
# Input
A triangulation, which is a planar graph with $m=3n-6$,
where $m$($n$) is the number of edges(vertices) of the graph respectively.\
Currently users guarantee the input is a triangulation,
which will be verified by the project in the future.\
The input json file is in the following format:
```json
{
  "0": ["1", "2"],
  "1": ["0"],
  "2": ["0"]
}
```
The keys are vertices of the graph, while the values are their neighbors.
# Output
The output json file is in the following format:
```json
{
  "0": [-1.0, -0.38],
  "1": [0.7, 0.15]
}
```
The keys are vertices of the graph,
while the values are their coordinates on the plane.\
This file can be visualized by using script/visualize.py:
```bash
python visualize.py triangle demo # create data/output/demo_triangle.png from data/input/triangle.json and data/output/demo_triangle.json
python visualize.py triangle      # create data/output/triangle.png from data/input/triangle.json and data/output/triangle.json
```
The difference between data/output/demo_triangle.json and data/output/triangle.json is that\
demo_triangle.json shall be offered by users,\
triangle.json shall be generated by our project.
